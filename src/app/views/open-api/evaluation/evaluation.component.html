          Please read the following instructions the task carefully!
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li>The goal of this evaluation is to collect engineering data for formalizing mappings 
            of HTTP-Request and -Responses Mappings based on JSON-Attributes. There exist a manual and a supported version for doing so.</li>
          <li>Unless explicitly indicated otherwise, you will only work with "OpenAPI"</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The "MANUAL" method is equivalent to implementing a software adpater using an IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code)</li>
              <li>The "SUPPORTED" method using a code generator to abstract and may be reusing already present mappings stored in a knowledge base</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The evaluation period will last from 21.10.2020 until 16.12.2020</li>
          <li>You may need longer for solving the tasks in the beginning. Expect for tasks up to 60 minutes of workload per week.
          </li>
          <li>Please familiarize yourself with the tool first. Therefore, please select "Server Endpoint - Example1" as a Mapping Source and "Server Endpoint - Example2" as a Mapping Target</li>
          <li>There are several depencendies when working on the tasks listed. These are defined as follows:</li>
          <br>
          <b>Tasks valid from 21.10.2020 until 28.10.2020. Last possible submission date is 28.10.2020 14:00 Romanian Time/15:00 German Time.</b>

        Process of executing a Task:
        <br><br>
        <ol>
          <li>Choose the assigned tasks to your name indicated by "Participant" from the dropdown menu "Task"
          <ul>
            <li>If the colum "Dependend is not empty, you need to wait until you are informed by the other participant (e.g. via Discord, ..) 
            that they have finished their task</li>
            <li>If the colum "Inform next Participant" is not empty, please inform the mentioned participant (e.g. via Discord, ..)
              that the task has been finished.
            </li>
            <li>In every other scenario, just start with the task
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
          <li>Click on "Start"
          <ul>
            <li>Web UI functionality</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Select pairs of attributes from the left and right by clicking on them based on your interpretation</li>
              <li>After selecting one attribute from each side, click on "Map Selceted"</li>
              <li>For Request Mappings, all attributes from the "Target Request Body" must be mapped</li>
              <li>For Response Mappings, all attributes from the "Source Response Body" must be mapped</li>
              <li>If some mappings are prefilled, you can reuse them immmediatly</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can test your mapping at any time using the "Test Mapping" functionality 
          <ul>
            <li>By clicking on "Test Request" all available request mappings are applied to the "Source Request Body" and send to the "Maping Target"</li>
            <li>Similar, all available response mappings are applied to the repsonse from the "Mapping Target" </li>
            <li>You do not have to specify any input parameters</li>
            <li>If your mappings are correct, then you sould see a valid response with the attrbutes of the "Source Request Body" in the "Output Data" field</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After you have mapped all required attirbutes, you will need to generate the software adapter</li>
        <ul>
          <li>When you click on "Build Adapter", you will receive an authentification toke</li>
          <li>This token must be copied and inserted on the website that wull be opened up automatically</li>
          <li>Within the generated software porject, you have to execute "node index.js" to check whether the adapter is working</li>
          <li>If the testcase is successfull, you can proceed with the next step</li>
          <li>If the testcase is unsuccessfull, you need to adapt the generated code manually</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you face any unsolvable difficulties, please also continue with the next step</li>
            <li>Please send a short notice to <a href="mailto:burzlaff@es.uni-mannheim.de">burzlaff@es.uni-mannheim.de</a> why you could not finish the task
            including the displayed error message, if available.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li> You can finish your task by clicking on "Finish Task"
          <ul>
            <li>When your task is finished, you will see a corresponding message. Please inform Fabian shortly in the Discord channel "#general"</li>
            <li>If there exist any error, then an Error-Message will be displayed at the bottom of the site</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
          <li>You can abort abort a task or reset the application at any time
          <ul>
            <li>In the "Task Overview", clicking on "Abort" may be required if you selcted the wrong task</li>
            <li>In the "Mapping Overview", clicking on "Reset" may be required if you want to reset all UI elements </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
          Please note the following remarks for working with this prototype:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
          <li>You can navigate back to the start page at any time by clicking on "HOME"</li>
          <li>You can open multiple tabs displaying different site content at the same time</li>
          <li>If you cannot find a button or other UI elements, try to scroll up and down</li>
          <li>Try not to use the refresh functionality of your browser (e.g. STRG+R). This may result in loss of unsaved work</li>
          <li>When you start a task, the time is measured automatically</li>
          <li>You can also send any suggestions for improvements (e.g. annotated screenshot) at any 
            time to <a href="mailto:burzlaff@es.uni-mannheim.de">burzlaff@es.uni-mannheim.de</a></li>
